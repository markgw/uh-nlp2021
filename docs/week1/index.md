# Week 1: Python for Java programmers, installing stuff and simple NLP

This week's material has two parts.
1. The first is a **short introduction to the Python 3 programming language**.
   We assume a good general programming knowledge.
   This means e.g. background in the Java programming language,
   on the level of *Introduction to Programming (Ohjelmoinnin perusteet)*
   and *Advanced Programming (Ohjelmoinnin jatkokurssi)*
   as taught at the department.
   For those who are **already familiar with Python**, this part serves
   as a refresher and can be skipped if you are confident in your Python
   programming knowledge.
2. The second part is about installing some required third party
   libraries and verifying they work by doing some simple NLP
   tasks that are common as the initial stages in NLP pipelines.

**Do not skip Part II, even if you are very familiar with Python:
it contains the marked assignments**.
At the same time, skimming through Part I might be useful
even if you've used Python before.

Most assignments after this week begin with some questions based on the
group work you did in the previous week's lectures.


> Sections that look like this designate assignments. While it's advisable to try out all examples, at the minimum work through these. This week only, some assignments that look like this are not returned to Moodle.

This week only, the page also contains assignments that
look like shown below. Any such assignments are graded and
count towards your course outcome. In the following weeks,
all assignments are marked.

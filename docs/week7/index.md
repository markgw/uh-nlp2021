# Week 6: NLG and Dialogue

Carry out all the exercises below and submit your answers on Moodle. Also submit a single Python file containing your full implementation.

## Exercise 1: The End-to-End NLG Challenge

Read the sections "Motivation" and "The Task" from the website of the [End-to-End NLG Challenge](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/InteractionLab/E2E/). Observe especially the MR format and the example natural language reference associated with it. Download the dataset from the website and inspect the file `devset.csv`. For the purposes of this week's assignments, the other files in the archive do not exist and you are not supposed to do anything with them.

> **Submit to Moodle** your answer to the following questions:
> 1. How difficult does the task appear to you?
> 2. Observe the scores reported in the section "Baseline System". Are they meaningful in isolation?
> 3. What are your thoughts on the variety of language in the references of the devset?

## Exercise 2: Trivial NLG

Download [week6utils.py](/week6utils.py) and store it in the same directory as `devset.csv`. In the same directory set up a python file with the following contents:

```python
from week6utils import read_file, score, MeaningRepresentation
from typing import Callable, List, Optional
import random

meaning_representations, references = read_file('devset.csv')

def generate_trivial(mr: MeaningRepresentation) -> str:
    """Trivial NLG."""
    return "{} is a {} {}.".format(mr.name, mr.food, mr.eat_type)


def evaluate(
    generator: Callable[[MeaningRepresentation], str],
    meaning_representations: List[MeaningRepresentation],
    references: List[List[str]],
) -> None:
    for _ in range(10):
        print(generator(random.choice(meaning_representations)))
    print("\n")
    score(generator, meaning_representations, references)
    print("\n----\n")


evaluate(generate_trivial, meaning_representations, references)
```

Familiarize yourself with the `MeaningRepresentation` class in `week6utils.py`, especially in terms of what fields it contains. 

If the code looks weird, it's probably because it contains type hints. In case you are unfamiliar with Python type hints, `foo: str` designates a variable `foo` that **should** be of type `str`. Many editors can then warn you if you are doing something that doesn't make sense according to the type hints. The type `Optional[str]` means the value can be either a string or `None`. `List[str]` is a list of strings, etc. You can read more about type hints in [the official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/typing.html) if you want, but you are free to ignore them. You do **not** have to add type hints to your own code.

Run the code a few times (5 or so) and observe the results. Note that the `score` method called inside `evaluate` applies your NLG-method to the whole `devset` corpus, not just the ten random samples shown to you.

> **Submit to Moodle** your answers to the following questions (one or two sentences per questions is enough):
> 1. What kinds of scores is this extremely simple system achieving?
> 2. How do they compare to the baseline results on the challenge's website?
> 3. Do you observe any problems with the output (other than it being so short)?

## Exercise 3: Less simple NLG

**NB:** In this and the following exercises you are asked to write new generation functions. You are expected to keep the old ones available, meaning that the code you return at the end of the week should contain all the variants you wrote during these exercises. Do **not** just keep overwriting the same function. If you want to use an older function as a starting point, copy and rename it.

Write a **new** generation function that realizes the three features in `generate_trivial` but **leave the original function untouched**. Your new system should inspect which of the three fields are not `None` and based on that decide what to output.

You can use the following as a starting point:
```python
def generate_2(mr: MeaningRepresentation) -> str:
    if mr.name and mr.food and mr.eat_type:
        return "{} is a {} {}.".format(mr.name, mr.food, mr.eat_type)
    elif mr.name and mr.food:
        raise NotImplementedError("Something needs to go here")
    elif mr.name and mr.eat_type:
        raise NotImplementedError("Something needs to go here")
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Something needs to go here")
```

Evaluate this improved version by calling `evaluate(generate_2, meaning_representations, references)`. 
> **Submit to Moodle** your answers to the following questions (one or two sentences per answer is sufficient):
> 1. Did your changes improve the evaluation scores?
> 2. Let us assume that the name is always present, but that all other features are optional. This means that if the MR consisted of only a name, there would be 2^0 = 1 variations of features being present or absent. In the above case, with name and two optional features, we had 2^2 = 4 variations of features being present or absent. How many variatations are there (i.e. how many if-statements would we need) for the full meaning representation in the `week6utils.py` file?
> 3. How many variations would there be if we introduced another feature into the meaning representation?

## Exercise 4: Finding the popular choice

Write code that makes a delexicalized **copy** of each reference available in the devset, e.g. turning

> Aromi is a coffee shop, which offers Chinese food, and has a customer rating of 5 out of 5. It is located in a riverside area.

into

> X-NAME is a X-EAT-TYPE, which offers X-FOOD food, and has a customer rating of X-CUSTOMER-RATING. It is located in a X-AREA area.

Note that you will need the original versions down the line, so don't modify them in place.

To obtain the delexicalized copies, you'll need to replace words from each reference based on what values the relevant MR has. This should not require tokenization. Ignore the `family_friendly` field when delexicalizing.

Hint: `for mr, refs in zip(meaning_representations, references)` might be useful, assuming `meaning_representations` is of type `List[MeaningRepresentation]` and `references` is of type `List[List[str]]`, like those obtained from calling `read_file()`.

After obtaining the delexicalized references, use `Counter` (recall first week's exercises) to determine the 10 most common (delexicalized) reference formats.

Take the most common reference format as a starting point, and write a function that realizes an arbitrary `MeaningRepresentation` into that sentence. You should **not** special case `None`: having them in the output is fine. Ignore the `family_friendly` field for now.

> **Submit to Moodle** your answers to the following questions:
> 1. What is the most common delexicalized reference? How many instances of it are in the devset?
> 2. Do you see any obvious patterns in the delexicalized references?
> 3. Evaluate your new generation function as above, how does it perform compared to the two previous functions?

## Exercise 5: Helper functions

### Exercise 5.1: Indefinite articles

Create the following helper function with a working implementation:
```python
def get_indefinite_article(word: str) -> str:
    """Return the indefinite article for a word.

    Output is either "a" or "an" depending on whether the input word's 
    pronunciation starts with a vowel sound (A, E, I, O, U).

    Pronunciations are retrieved from `nltk.corpus.cmudict`. Words 
    for which there is no known pronunciation return based on the 
    first character in the string.
    """
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

Use the following helper to retrieve the pronunciation of the word (you need to run `nltk.download('cmudict')` at least once beforehand):
```python
from nltk.corpus import cmudict
pronunciations = cmudict.dict()
def pronounce(word: str) -> Optional[List[str]]:
    """Return a pronunciation of a word.

    If the word is unknown, returns None. 
    
    For known words, output is a list of strings wherein each string
    corresponds to a phoneme. If the word has multiple known
    pronunciations, returns an arbitrary one of those.

    Example:
    >>> pronounce("Hello")
    ['HH', 'AH0', 'L', 'OW1']
    """
    word = word.lower()
    if word not in pronunciations:
        return None
    return pronunciations[word][0]
```

You can test your code with the following `assert` statements:
```python
assert get_indefinite_article("dog") == "a"
assert get_indefinite_article("fish") == "a"
assert get_indefinite_article("university") == "a"
assert get_indefinite_article("utopia") == "a"
assert get_indefinite_article("idiot") == "an"
assert get_indefinite_article("element") == "an"
assert get_indefinite_article("honor") == "an"
assert get_indefinite_article("heirloom") == "an"
```

Create also the following function with a working implementation:
```python
def realize_articles(text: str) -> str:
    """Realize INDEF_ART tokens as suitable indefinite articles.

    Replaces instances of "INDEF_ART" in text with the suitable form of the
    indefinite article ("a" or "an") as necessitated by the following word.

    Internally calls get_indefinite_article(). Input is tokenized using
    nltk.tokenize.treebank.TreebankWordTokenizer.tokenize() and detokenized 
    using nltk.tokenize.treebank.TreebankWordDetokenize.detokenize().

    As nltk.tokenize.treebank.TreebankWordTokenizer.tokenize() assumes input
    is a sentence, uses nltk.sent_tokenize() to split input into sentences.
    
    Capitalization is handled gracefully: sentence-first articles are
    correctly capitalized.
    """
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

You can test your code with the followin `assert` statements:
```python
assert realize_articles("This is INDEF_ART example.") == "This is an example."
assert realize_articles("This is INDEF_ART test.") == "This is a test."
assert realize_articles('INDEF_ART test. INDEF_ART example.') == "A test. An example."
assert (
    realize_articles(
        "This was, truly, INDEF_ART honor Mr. Lincoln. But this is INDEF_ART complex example."
    )
    == "This was, truly, an honor Mr. Lincoln. But this is a complex example."
)
assert (
    realize_articles("FBI is INDEF_ART famous organization.")
    == "FBI is a famous organization."
)
```

You should only create the (de)tokenizer once, storing it outside the function, rather than creating a new instance every time the function is called. The same holds for the `cmudict.dict()`.

### Exercise 5.2: Lists

Create the following helper function with a working implementation:
```python
def combine(components: List[Optional[str]], conjunction: str = " and ") -> Optional[str]:
    """Describe list in natural language.

    The output consists of the non-None values in the list separated by the 
    string ", ". The exception are the last and second-to-last components 
    which are instead separated by `conjunction`, by default the string 
    " and ". None values in `components` are ignored. In case `components` 
    is empty or contains only None values, returns None.
    """
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

You can test your code with the following `assert` statements:
```python
assert combine(["a"]) == "a"
assert combine(["a", "b"]) == "a and b"
assert combine(["a", "b", "c"]) == "a, b and c"
assert combine(["a", "b", "c", "d"]) == "a, b, c and d"
assert combine(["a", "b"], conjunction=" or ") == "a or b"
assert combine([]) is None
assert combine([None]) is None
assert combine(["a", None, "b"]) == "a and b"
```

### Exercise 5.3: Referring expressions

Create the following helped function with a working implementation:
```python
def realize_referring_expressions(text: str, name: str) -> str:
    """Realize X-NAME and X-NAME-POSS tokens in text.
    
    The first X-NAME or X-NAME-POSS is replaced with the contents of the 
    name parameter. Subsequent X-NAME and X-NAME-POSS tokens are replaced 
    by the word "it". The name  parameter's capitalization is retained as-is, 
    whereas the word "it" is capitalized if it's sentence-first.

    For the string X-NAME-POSS, the realization is the possessive form, i.e.
    "its" instead of "it". The parameter `name` is appended with an apostrophe
    if the final letter is an "s" and with an "'s" otherwise.

    For processing, the text is split into sentences using nltk.sent_tokenize()
    and those sentences are then tokenized into words using
    nltk.tokenize.treebank.TreebankWordTokenizer.tokenize().
    
    The modified sentences (sequences of tokense) are detokenized 
    using nltk.tokenize.treebank.TreebankWordDetokenize.detokenize() and combined
    back into a single string using " ".join(). 
    """
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

It's worth noting that the above description of the possessive is not uncontroversial, as different style guides disagree on what the "proper" use of the possessive is. Some style guides go as far as to have different rules for names depending on whether the name is classical ('Zeus', 'Socrates') or Biblical **and** how many syllables it has. It gets really complicated and nobody agrees on what is correct, so the above is a good middle ground that everyone is going to understand.

>**Optional reading**: 
>- [Possessives in the AP and Chicago style guide](https://apvschicago.com/2011/06/apostrophe-s-vs-apostrophe-forming.html).
>- [Merriam-Webster's take on possessives](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/what-happens-to-names-when-we-make-them-plural-or-possessive)


You can test your implementation with the following `assert` statements:
```python
assert realize_referring_expressions("X-NAME is a thing.", "Bar") == "Bar is a thing."
assert (
    realize_referring_expressions("X-NAME is a thing. X-NAME is good.", "Foo")
    == "Foo is a thing. It is good."
)
assert (
    realize_referring_expressions(
        "The X-NAME is also a thing. However, X-NAME is not good.", "Buz"
    )
    == "The Buz is also a thing. However, it is not good."
)
assert realize_referring_expressions("X-NAME-POSS car.", "Harry") == "Harry's car."
assert (
    realize_referring_expressions(
        "I call my car X-NAME. X-NAME-POSS mileage is superb but X-NAME-POSS acceleration is rubbish.",
        "Dave",
    )
    == "I call my car Dave. Its mileage is superb but its acceleration is rubbish."
)
assert realize_referring_expressions('X-NAME-POSS', 'Dave') == "Dave's"
assert realize_referring_expressions('X-NAME-POSS', 'Charles') == "Charles'"

```

> **Submit to Moodle a single file containing working and correct implementations for all functions defined above.** Remember to test your implementations with the provided assert statements.

## Exercise 6: The big one

Implement a generator function that gracefully realizes all values in the meaning representations. Ensure that there are no `None`s in your output: only the field `name` is quaranteed to be present, all other fields can be `None`

Note that certain fields can have values of multiple forms of non-`None` values:

- `customer_rating` can be either a word (e.g. "average") or a score (e.g. "1 out of 5"),
- `family_friendly` can be either "yes" or "no", and
- `price_range` can be either a range (e.g. "£20-25") or a word (e.g. "cheap").

Make sure the produced text makes sense in all cases. You will likely need to check which version of the value the MR has and select on two slightly different phrasings based on that.

Whatever you do, do **not** simply extend the code from Exercise 3 into a 100+ line long `if-elif-elif-elif...` statement.

A good starting place is to come up with an example output, e.g. `"The Eagle is a family-friendly coffee shop serving English food. It is located in city centre, near Burger King. It has prices in the range of £20-25 and has a high customer rating."`.

Here, having family friendliness undefined (`family_friendly` is `None`) is easy to achieve by simply omitting `"family-friendly"` from the output, but it's not so easy to negate the statement in the above format, as saying `"non-family-friendly"` sounds unnatural. For that, we can instead output `"It is not family friendly."` at the end. That is, depending on the `family_friendly` value, the output could be

- If `family_friendly` is "yes" `"The Eagle is a family-friendly coffee shop serving English food. It is located in city centre, near Burger King. It has prices in the range of £20-25 and has a high customer rating."`
- If `family_friendly` is `None`: `"The Eagle is coffee shop serving English food. It is located in city centre, near Burger King. It has prices in the range of £20-25 and has a high customer rating."`
- If `family_friendly` is "no": `"The Eagle is coffee shop serving English food. It is located in city centre, near Burger King. It has prices in the range of £20-25 and has a high customer rating. It is not family friendly."`

It might be a good idea to generate the text in chunks, e.g. as follows:

```
[
    [
        [The Eagle] 
        is 
        a 
        [family-friendly] 
        [coffee shop] 
        [
            serving 
            [English]
            food
        ]
        .
    ]
    [
        It 
        is 
        located
        [
            in 
            [city centre]
        ]
        ,
        [
            near 
            [Burger King]
        ]
        .
    ]
    [
        It 
        [
            has 
            prices 
            in 
            the 
            range 
            of 
            [£20-25]
        ]
        and
        [ 
            has 
            a 
            [high] 
            customer 
            rating
        ]
        .
    ]
]
```

Remember the helper functions created in the previous assignments -- they can be very helpful. For example, the chunk containing the `area` and `near` values could be generated like this:

```python
    def location(mr: MeaningRepresentation) -> Optional[str]:
        area = "in {}".format(mr.area) if mr.area else None
        near = "near {}".format(mr.near) if mr.near else None
        if area is None and near is None:
            return None
        return "It is located {}.".format(
            combine([area, near], conjunction=", ")
        )
```
The call to `combine` handles the possibly `None` values of `area` and `near` automatically: only the case of both being `None` at the same time needs to be handled separately. The same approach can be used to generate the other chunks. Finally, in the end, combine all the chunks into a single string.

Take care to handle all instances of "a" and "an" using the helper functions if they are, or could be, followed by text from the meaning representation. For example, the "a" preceding "family-friendly" in the above example could also be "an" in a case where `family_friendly` was `"no"` or `None` and `eat_type` was `"inn"` (even if that value doesn't exist in the dataset we are working with).

**Evaluating this implementation might take a few minutes, mainly because the pronounciation lookups are slow**. When developing the solution, consider temporarily commenting out the call to `score()` and just looking at the example outputs. When working on later exercises, consider commenting out the call to `evaluate()`.

> **Submit to Moodle** the output of calling `evaluate()` on your generator, both the examples and the numerical results. You can either build your generator along the above description, or do something different. 
>
> If you do something different, only assume that the `name` field is always present. Your output should be able to realize all possible combinations of fields being present or absent. Any present fields must be reflected to output.


## Exercise 7: Reflection

>**Submit to Moodle** you answers to the following questions. Keep your answers short: a few sentences each is sufficient.
> 1. Think of another language you speak (or atleast know a bit about). How much work would it be to translate the system to that language? Try to consider cases like the "a" vs. "an" in English. Give examples of difficult things you come up with, if any.
> 2. Using the Gatt & Krahmer classification (Refer to slides), how would you characterize the system you built? Why?
> 3. Think back to your answers to Exercise #1. Did the task turn out easier or more difficult than you anticipated? What didn't you anticipate?
> 4. Think about the pros and cons of the neural systems as discussed in the lecture. Do you think this task is good for them (consider the data, the complexity etc.)? Do you expect them to fare better than "classical" systems?
> 5. How do the Baseline scores on the E2E website compare to your scores? How did you compare to the other system reported in Table 3 of the [Findings of the E2E NLG Challenge -paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01170.pdf)?
> 6. Look at the same table. Check from the caption how the colors match the system architectures. How are the rule-based and template-based systems faring against the seq2seq and other data-driven systems? Does this match your expectation from before?

**NB:** Regarding the evaluation, note that we are doing the manual version to what overfitting is in machine learning: we identified our approach (~trained our model) from the same dataset we are using to test it. Our results are **not** directly comparable to those reported on the E2E website. 

## Exercise 8: Explore BLEU

Import the `bleu_single` method from `week6utils.py`. Pick some NL realisation, either from those you generated or from the `devset.csv`. Call it the *reference*.

Try out different modifications to the reference and calculate the BLEU scores between the original and the modified reference. Try to come up with a pair of modifications where candidate #1 has the same logical content (i.e. same information) as the reference and candidate #2 contains some falsehood, but the BLEU scores rank candidate #2 higher than candidate #1.

>**Submit to Moodle** the reference and the candidates you found together with the BLEU scores. What does this tell you about the BLEU scores as a metric? What is the problem with the way we are using the BLEU score? Recall the assumptions behind these kinds of metrics from the slides.


## Exercise 9: Human Evaluation

>**Submit to Moodle** your answers to the following questions. A few sentences each is sufficient.
> 1. What kinds of questions would you ask if you were to conduct an intrinstic human evaluation of the restaurant description task? 2-3 questions is sufficient.
> 2. You are giving human judges a generated restaurant description together with the corresponding restaurant's menu, its location on a map and a sample of its customer reviews. Each judge then tells you whether, in their opinion, the text matches the info they have. Why is this task an instrinsic evaluation?
> 3. You modify the above procedure. Instead of one info package, you now give the judges multiple slightly different info packages of which only one is the one corresponding to the restaurant. The judges are then asked to identify which info package the generated description corresponds to. Why is this task an extrinsic evaluation?
> 4. Read Section 4.2 from the [Findings of the E2E NLG Challenge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01170.pdf) paper. How did seq2seq systems compare to others in terms of naturalness and quality? Do these results differ from the automated evaluations?
> 5. Come up with at least one example of both a system where correctness is much more important than fluency/naturalness, and one where the reverse holds true. You don't have to limit your examples to the restaurant domain.

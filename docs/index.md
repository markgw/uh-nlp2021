# Natural Language Processing 2021

## Course

Masters course at the University of Helsinki
Department of Computer Science.

The course consists of hybrid teaching sessions, partly
short lectures and partly group and individual assignments
to be carried out during the session and instructions
will be provided during the lecture.

### Assignments

In addition, each week there is a short individual assignment
to complete in your own time. These individual assignments
can be found on the pages below.

Each assignment begins with some questions relating to the
group work carried out during lectures. These should be
quick and easy to answer, with the help of the notes or answers
your group submitted during lectures.

Then there are some further questions or tasks for you to carry
out on your own.

### Warning: don't start early!

Note that the content of each assignment may change
**up until the lecture when it is released** (Monday of each week).
Please therefore do not start the assignment until its
release date, or else you might end up doing to wrong thing!

## Final project

As well as weekly assignments, students must submit a
[final project](final_project/)
that puts into practice some of the principles,
models and tools encountered in the course.

You may choose your own topic. It may be an extension of
the work done in one of the assignments, or something else.
At the bottom of each week's assignment are some suggestions
for how you might consider extending it.
